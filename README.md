The var keyword is used in the Java code snippet as part of a feature called local variable type inference, introduced in Java 10.  
  
In this context, var is used to infer the type of the continent variable based on the return type of the switch expression. This helps in reducing verbosity and can enhance code readability.  
  
The type of continent is inferred to be String in this case.
